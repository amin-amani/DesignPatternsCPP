This code implements a game with a 3x3 tile field. In each level, the player is presented with a certain number of tanks randomly placed on the field, and has six shots to hit as many tanks as possible. As the level increases, the number of tanks decreases, making the game more challenging.

To encapsulate the creation of tanks with random positions, the code uses a factory class. The factory class generates a specified number of tanks with random positions on the field, and returns them to the game for use. This approach allows the game to easily create new tanks with random positions as needed, without exposing the details of the tank creation process.

Overall, the code provides an engaging and challenging game experience, while also demonstrating the benefits of using a factory class to encapsulate the creation of complex objects with randomized attributes.
